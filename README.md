# Predict-flights tickets
 Business Case:
The flight ticket price in India is based on demand and supply model
with few restriction on pricing from regulatory bodies. It is often
perceived as unpredictable and , recent dynamic pricing scheme
added to the confusion.
The objective is to create a machine learning model for predicting
the flight price, based on historical data, which can be used for
reference price for customers as well as airline service providers.

PROJECT GOAL: 1. Creating a machine learning for predicting flight ticket price
with high accuracy.
